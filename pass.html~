		<div class="entry">

			<p>This tool will generate some random easy to remember semi-pronounceable passwords. Passes are generated by alternating
			consonants, vowels and numbers. Each password is broken into dash-separated syllables which are up to 4 characters long.
			You can keep these dashes as part of your password or drop them when you type it in. Dashes don't count against the
			character limit.</p>

			<p>Default is 10 passwords, each 8 characters long.</p>
