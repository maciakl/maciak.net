					I work in the real world. I live on the internet. Mostly...</p>

				       
					<p>I am a certified geek, technology blogger, programmer and a systems administrator. I also teach "Fluency in Technology" at <a href="http://montclair.edu">Montclair State University</a> as an adjunct professor.</p> 
					
					<p>The most web-visible of my activities is probably my blog <a href="http://www.terminally-incoherent.com">Terminally Incoherent</a> which does seem to have a small but loyal readership.</p> 
					
					<p>There are few links to some of my past and current projects in the sidebar. Check out the Publications tab to see my academic work.</p>
